# Game Of Life

This is an implementation of John Conway's "cellular automation" written in Java.

# Brief Overview

1. The game has a graphical user interface.
2. It supports different grid dimensions and set of initial parameters unlike the original game. 
3. The program has load/save functionality and is supplied with some interesting game patterns for you to try out. 
4. In addition to loading an existing game file you can create a new grid and design your own pattern by clicking on the cells. 
5. Pressing the play button will result in running the simulation continuosly, the speed of which can be adjusted with a slider. 
6. The game can be paused by pressing the pause button or clicking anywhere on the grid during the simulation. 
7. Pressing "Next" button will only display the next state of the pattern. 

# Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Load the src folder and direct into it in the terminal.
2. Complie the program with `javac *.java`.
3. Run the game with `java Main`.

# Try it out 

If you want to try out a slightly different implementation of the program that suports very large grid sizes (e.g 500x500), run the the alternateSulotion instead. 
However, it was shown to only work to our personal machines and not lab machines.
